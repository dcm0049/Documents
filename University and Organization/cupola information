SPaRC is an organization that gives students tools and resources to work on their own projects. Students have the opportunity to give a presentation to a panel of professors and faculty about their potential research project. Then, the faculty decides whether or not to fund the student’s project. Past projects include a recycling robot, a robot for a “Robot Basketball Game,” and a Tesla Coil. Next to the SPaRC lab is a robotics lab. This is a good opportunity to talk about mechanical and ECE working together (engineers work on the same projects from different angles).
